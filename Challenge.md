We want to see your experience in three different fields: frontend graphics, interaction and backend.
The primary objective is to show us how you work and what is important for you.
Since we are writing our source code in TypeScript, we would like you to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

Storing of moves (Backend):
Chess move information entered in a text field must be stored on a backend side database.
Please use a Node.js based web server and store the data inside a MongoDB. Transfer data via WebSocket.

Display a chess board (Frontend graphics):
Develop a web solution that is showing a chess board and pieces in the default position.
Use any frontend technology you like, with the exception of chess libraries.

Moving pieces (Frontend interaction):
Make pieces movable on the board by drag’n drop.
Any piece can be moved to any field.
No move validation is needed.
It’s up to you to decide what to do with multiple pieces on the same field (multiple pieces per field, disallow move, take the piece like in chess, etc.)

Bonus
Connect the frontend chess board with the backend service. Store the moves entered on the chess board.
